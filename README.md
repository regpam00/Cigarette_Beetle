## Summary of Report: 

* The interactions of insects and microbes on harvested food products have been well-documented in food facilities.
* The destructive results have caused billions of dollars in economic damages and led to exposure to toxic compounds, especially those from fungal species. :mushroom:
* However, research is limited on how certain fungal species affect the behavior of a common food pest, the [cigarette beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasioderma_serricorne) (_Lasioderma serricorne_). :beetle:
* Fungal pests emit microbially-produced volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) that may influence the beetle's behavior.
* Researchers tested this hypothesis using two commonly widespread pre- and post-harvest fungi, _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Fusarium verticillioides_, grown on inoculated grain. :ear_of_rice: :petri_dish:
* The results showed that changes in MVOC emissions affected the beetle's close- and long-range foraging.
